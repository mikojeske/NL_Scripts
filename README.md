# Disclaimer
These scripts were developed by me (Nicolas Leenaerts) for my research, but they can be used by anybody who thinks that they can help with their own research. I believe that the scripts are correct, but emplore other researchers to check the scripts before using them.

# Description
The scripts were written in multiple coding languages (R, Python, bash, Matlab). They were mean to work with different types of data (ESM/EMA, fMRI, PET, etc.) and were used for different analyses.

## R scripts

## Python scripts

## bash scripts

## Matlab scripts

# Still under construction.
